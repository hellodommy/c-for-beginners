# Section 1: Introduction

## Terminology

CPU
* Does most of work
* Instructions executed here

RAM (random access memory)
* Stores data of program while it is running

Hard Drive (permanent storage)
* stores files that contain program source code *even when computer is turned off*

Operating System
* Make it more convenient to use computers
* Controls entire operations of computer
    * Input output
    * Manages resources and execution of programs

Fetch/Execute Cycle (life of CPU)
* Fetches instruction from memeory using registers and executes it (loop)
* Gigahertz CPU can do ~billion times a second

## High Level Programming Language
* Makes it easier to write prorgams
* Opposite of assembly language (ow level)
* Describe actions in a more abstract form
* No need to worry about precise steps for CPU (eg. MIPS)

### Compiler
* Translates high level source code into detailed set of machine language instructions the computer requires
* Program does high-level thinking, compiler generates tedious instructions to CPU
* Check that program has valid syntax, finds errors and reports them to you

## Writing a Program
1. Define program objectives
    * Understand requirements
2. Design the program
    * Decide how program will meet requirements
3. Write the code
    * Translate design in C syntax
4. Compile
5. Run program
    * Executable file is program you can run
6. Test and debug
7. Maintain and modify

* Work in small steps and constantly test (divide and conquer)
